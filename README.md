## Java Questions

Drivers are concerned with the mileage their automobiles get. One driver has kept track of several
trips by recording the miles driven and gallons of fuel used. Develop a java application that shall
input the miles driven and gallons used (both as integers) for each trip. The program should
calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for all trips, stating how many trips, how many
gallons and the mileage. Use the scanner object to obtain the data from the user.
